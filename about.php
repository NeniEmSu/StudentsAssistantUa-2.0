                    About Me
                </h1>
                <p>Am Neni Emmanuel Sulku a Nigerian by nationality & a Gombite (A person from Gombe) studying in
                    Ukraine, currently I am a 5th year medical student at Ternopol State Medical University (TSMU),
                    I love to learn new and interesting stuff, I code when not studying for school or at church and
                    play the violin on my free time.<br><br>

                    During my years of study I've learnt a lot and have seen my mates and predecessors learn and
                    pass on the skills that the university has impacted into us to others and I aim to make the
                    knowledge we've acquired to last the test of time thus I decided to "use my code to do Good" and
                    make StudentsAssistantUA.<br><br>

                    I've learnt a lot and am greatfull to all those who thought me something in the past and are
                    still teaching. I may look like a one man team but my MVPs are the real OGs.<br><br>
