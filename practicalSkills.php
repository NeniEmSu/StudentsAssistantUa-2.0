                    <h3>What is OSCE and the Rules How to Pass It</h3>
                    <h4>Information for Students</h4>
                    <p>Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is a modern up-to-date method of evaluation of
                        the students’ practical knowledge and skills, designed to test the clinical performance and
                        competence in a range of skills that cannot be assessed by traditional forms of examinations.
                        Each station assesses one or more areas of clinical competence (for example, history taking,
                        communication, physical examination skills, etc.). The assessment applies a standardized
                        approach, which includes standardized patients (SPs), standardized scoring tools, and
                        standardized exam-day logistics.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Basic principles of OSCE</h4>
                    <p>О – оbjective – all students perform tasks of the same complexity, which are evaluated using the
                        standardized scoring tool (check-list);</p>
                    <p>S – structured – every student experiences the same problems, and is asked to perform the same
                        task, within the same timeframe. Students move sequentially from one station to another one
                        according to a certain route, performing tasks of the same level of difficulty;</p>
                    <p>C – сlinical – The tasks in each OSCE station represent real-life clinical situations in which
                        students apply the acquired theoretical knowledge and practical skills; </p>
                    <p>E – еxamination – competence and skills of students are assessed on the basis of the above
                        principles.</p>
                    <h4>Venue</h4>
                    <p>OSCE will take place in the inter-departmental Simulation Training Center. During the exam,
                        ongoing video surveillance is underway.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Who should pass OSCE?</h4>
                    <p>Students of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th courses on the specialty "Medicine" as well as students of the
                        3rd and 4th courses on the specialty "Dentistry" should pass the OSCE in the last month of the
                        semester before the semester examinations. One exam group, numbering 12 students, passes the
                        exam simultaneously. Examination groups are formed by the dean's office before the exam.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Passing OSCE (How to move along the route)</h4>
                    <p>
                        After receiving the instructions, you are pre-assigned to start at a specific station indicated
                        on your badge (your sequential number) and then pass to the next number of station. For example,
                        if there are 12 stations, and your first station number is 4, you might start at Station No.4
                        and rotate through stations 5,6,7, 8,9,10,11,12,1,2,3. Signs throughout the examination route
                        will help you navigate through your stations. <br>
                        Performing tasks at stations starts and ends with a ringing tone. </p>
                    <p>
                        In front of the station door, you will see instructions for that station. With a ringtone, you
                        should enter the room, receive a task, and execute it. </p>
                    <p>
                        All the writing forms you will be given on a station should be handled to the examiner of the
                        station after you will complete the task. </p>
                    <p>
                        Time to complete the task is 6 minutes. At the end of this time, the next ringtone will signal
                        that you must exit the room and go to the next room (station) along the route.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If in 6 minutes you did not handle the task, stop working and leave the room with a ringtone,
                        handling to the examiner the writing forms. If you handle the task before the time of station
                        completing, you must stay in the room until the ending of 6-min period (it will be singled by
                        ringtone).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Performing tasks at the following stations starts with the next ringtone. The time interval
                        between stations, to pass from one station to another, is equal to 1 min.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You and other candidates will rotate through all the stations on the track, so to pass through
                        all 12 stations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the examination begins, washroom and other breaks are not provided.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Physical arrangement of stations </h4>
                    <p>
                        Each examination station is unique. <br> The equipment and setting in the station will vary
                        depending on the purpose of the station. For example, if a physical examination is part of the
                        station, you can expect to find:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            An exam table, sometimes with the phantom or patient already sitting on it or in a chair.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A kit of tools for you to use. You will have to bring your own stethoscope for the exam.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A copy of the scenario task will be provided inside each station for you. </li>
                        <li> a response form that must be filled out by the student (at some stations).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If the station requires other materials, such as a growth chart, lab results or other relevant
                        information, these will be in the station.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Violation of the rules </h4>
                    <p>
                        If you are late, you will not be allowed to take the exam.<br>
                        During the exam you are prohibited from communicating with each other and with an examiner. <br>
                        If you violate the rules of safety and conduct or use the educational materials and/or gadgets,
                        your personal exam results may be cancelled.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Communication during the exam </h4>
                    <p>
                        An examiner will be observing, assessing and recording your performance while you do the task.
                        Do not pay attention to an examiner facial expression or making marks on the score sheet. Do
                        your best to focus on the patient and demonstrate your clinical competence without focusing on
                        the examiner. <br>
                        You can apply to the examiner in case of deterioration of well-being or in force majeure
                        circumstances.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The examiner may address you verbally in case of:</h4>

                            something like, “Please reread the instructions” or "Carry out auscultation at the point
                            indicated by blue color, please".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            after you have performed some maneuver, the examiner may provide the results of the maneuver
                            as if you had completed it. For example, after your demonstration of chest percussion the
                            examiner may then say, “There is dullness in the paravertebral area on the right.” If no
                            information is provided, move on. Do not look to the examiner for information or ask if they
                            have information for you (all necessary data should be available in the task given).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>How to repass OSCE?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In case of absence or negative result on the exam, you will have the opportunity to repass it in
                        due time according to the schedule of the dean's office.
                    </p>

                    <h4>OSCE evaluation </h4>
                    <p>
                        At each station, the examiner, without interfering with the process of performing the task,
                        evaluates your actions and indicates the result by marking it in a check-list.<br>
                        The maximum score for the task at 1 station is 1 (one) point. The maximum number of points for
                        OSCE is 12. <br>
                        The exam results will be known on the day of passing after processing all the check-lists.
                        The exam is considered to be compiled if you scored at least 7.0 points.
                    </p>

                    <h4>If Not Agree With the Result </h4>
                    <p>
                        If you do not agree with the exam results, you can file an appeal within 2 days.
                        The appeal is considered by the commission, the decision is taken after viewing the video
                        recording of your exam.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What happens after the examination </h4>
                    <p>
                        When you are finished the OSCE, you have to return your candidate badge and pen (pencil). Then
                        you leave the examination floor through the ‘Exit’ passage.
                    </p>

                    <h4>OSCE security requirements </h4>
                    <p>
                        Students are prohibited to discuss, copy, reproduce or share examination content in any way, at
                        any time before, during, and after the exam.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Other tips </h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Do not be tempted to do MORE than what the station instructions require.</b> For example, if
                        the instructions say to “take a focused history”, then do exactly that – do not complete a full
                        patient interview covering issues that may not be relevant. <br>
                        <b>Do be guided by the information that the patient tells you.</b> Apply your clinical reasoning
                        to the patient’s pertinent answers during the history and physical exam portions of the
                        stations. <br>
                        <b>Do not make assumptions about the purpose of the station.</b> You may think, for example,
                        “Oh, this must be the depression station”, but keep an open mind. You are being assessed on your
                        active clinical skills. Be guided by the patient’s responses. <br>
                        <b>Do communicate with the patient well.</b> The examiners will assess you, not only on what you
                        say and ask, but on how you communicate with the patient. <br>
                        <b>Do manage your time well.</b> Because OSCE stations have time limitations, time management is
                        crucial.
